# Vue.js

## Reasons to use

These are the assumptions we are trying to prove with this test project:

1. No need to write JS manually
2. Reactive: only the data changes not the code, ie. a code once written can display a data continuously growing over time
3. It's like any other website: has server side rendering for SEO, normal URLs, etc.
4. Full components support
5. Has best practices embedded like linting, testing, ES5 syntax, asset caching etc
6. Easy workflow: just code and the rest is done (CLI, local server, hot reloading, code concatenation / building etc)
7. Easy deploying: build and copy. Done at http://metamn.io/test1/

## Components

> For example, you can put each component in its own directory, with its static assets right next to it.

## Server side pre-rendering

- used these instructions and all went fine: http://vuejs-templates.github.io/webpack/prerender.html
- the html looks pretty ok: http://imgur.com/a/79daL
- when pre-rendering commented out after a new build the `app` container was empty as expected: `... </head><body><div id=app></div><script type=text/javascript ...`

## Dev console

- after installing Vue Dev Tools I'm able to interact with the app data: http://imgur.com/a/6jgkh

## Page Speed

- 78/100: https://developers.google.com/speed/pagespeed/insights/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fmetamn.io%2Ftest1%2F
- 71/100 for metamn.io

## Deploying

- after and `npm run build` and copying to http://metamn.io/test1/ the CSS was not loaded
- that's because the CSS link was `href="/static/css/app.ce027eb1c4fdfea5bce4f5e466a381dd.css"`
- changing to `href="http://metamn.io/test1/static/css/app.ce027eb1c4fdfea5bce4f5e466a381dd.css"` did the trick
- the change has to be done in `config/index.js` http://vuejs-templates.github.io/webpack/backend.html
- the change was: `assetsPublicPath: '/test1/',`
