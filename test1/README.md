# Vue.js

## Reasons to use

These are assumptions we are trying to prove with this test project

1. No need to write JS manually
2. Reactive: only the data changes not the code, ie. a code once written can display a data continuously growing over time
3. It's like any other website: has server side rendering for SEO, normal URLs, etc.
4. Full components support

## Components

> For example, you can put each component in its own directory, with its static assets right next to it.
