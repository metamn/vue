# TLDR 1

The ecosystem of Vue is not so advanced like the React.

For example in React we have styleguide driven development, and styled components.
Best things and tools go down to Vue with a delay, if they'll even go down.

On the other hand everything is so new ... we have CSS Modules support for vue-loader but I don't know how to properly integrate and there are no docs on the net yet ...

Things are changing so fast ... Today Wordpress announced they are ditching React .. they were the biggest open source React project ever ...

It's good to wait for things to settle down ...
