# Vue.js 

## Reasons to use

These are the assumptions we are trying to prove with this test project:

1. No need to write JS manually
2. Reactive: only the data changes not the code, ie. a code once written can display a data continuously growing over time
3. It's like any other website: has server side rendering for SEO, normal URLs, etc.
4. Full components support
5. Has best practices embedded like linting, testing, ES5 syntax, asset caching etc
6. Easy workflow: just code and the rest is done (CLI, local server, hot reloading, code concatenation / building etc)
7. Easy deploying: build and copy. Done at http://metamn.io/test1/
8. Native support: https://weex.incubator.apache.org/


## Components

1. There are lots of reusable components out there like Material Design for Vue ... we should find a strategy here how to proceed to not reinvent the wheel (https://github.com/vuejs/awesome-vue, https://curated.vuejs.org/)
